# Mono Loot Fabricator

MI-styled Loot Fabricator upgrade. Doesn't have any downsides compared to its regular counterpart, its big selling point is the overclocking. Make sure to build a ton of 'em!

Just like a regular Loot Fabricator, you need to select a loot, only this time it's a panel on the left side. 'MI-styled' is quite literal here!
