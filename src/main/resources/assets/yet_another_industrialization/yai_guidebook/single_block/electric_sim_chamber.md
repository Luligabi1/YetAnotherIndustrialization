# Electric Simulation Chamber
###### *yeah, the name is very redundant, but I didn't have much to work here, alright!?*

MI-styled Simulation Chamber sidegrade. Has both up and downsides:

§2§l+ §r§aOverclockable

§2§l+ §r§aAlways generates Generalized Predictions

§4§l- §r§cUses tier's base accuracy rather than current data accuracy
