# Single Block Machines

HNI offers MI-styled **Simulation Chambers** and **Loot Fabricators** in the form of the [Electric Simulation Chamber](./single_block/electric_sim_chamber.md) and [Mono Loot Fabricator](./single_block/mono_loot_fabricator.md) respectively.

Make sure you have the following before proceeding: 
- 
- **Analog Circuits** and the ability to craft its components;
- Sufficient energy generation for MI. You cannot use the same energy as HNN for these machines;
- Any Data Model at Basic tier or higher.
