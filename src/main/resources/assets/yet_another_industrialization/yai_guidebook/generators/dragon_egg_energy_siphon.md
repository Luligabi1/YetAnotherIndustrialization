# Dragon Egg Energy Siphon

Dragon Egg Energy Siphons are capable of generating energy by harnessing the Dragon Egg's power... Not! I mean, this is MI. Nothing is truly passive here :P

## Producing energy

To Start, centrifuge your **Dragon Breath** bottles to acquire it as a fluid. Each bottle equals to 350mB.

Using an **Assembler**, craft some **Dragon Egg Siphon Catalysts** with **Steel Plates**, a single **Quartz Tiny Dust** and **Dragon Breath**. They're consumed everytime energy is generated.

Finally, input a **Dragon Egg Siphon Catalyst** and 1000mB of **Dragon Breath** to produce energy!

## Aftermath

After producing energy, the inserted Dragon Breath becomes **Impure Dragon Breath**. 

At this state, it cannot be used for anything, so you'll need to purify it by centrifuging it. Doing so might also yield some **Quartz Tiny Dust**.

## Better yields?

All aspects of this processing chain can be improved by replacing regular Dragon Breath with **Nutrient Dragon Breath** (more on it at [Arboreous Greenhouse](../machines/arboreous_greenhouse.md)).
